{"name":"50","tagline":"\"50\" curates grants, scholarships and FA encouraging diversity in STEM fields among half the world's population!","body":"**[50](http://svaksha.github.io/50)** is a curated list of grants, scholarships, travel and financial aid for women from all over the world, that is being offered by conferences and companies sponsoring STEM education to encourage diversity in STEM fields among __half the world's population__.\r\n\r\n- [50](#50)\r\n- [LICENSE](#license)\r\n   - [Mirrors](#mirrors)\r\n- [CONTRIBUTING](#contributing)\r\n\r\n\r\n# 50\r\nInformation is divided into the following sub-pages:\r\n\r\n- [Events.md](https://github.com/svaksha/50/blob/master/Events.md) :: Financial aid and travel grant information for women attending or speaking at barcamps, camps, conferences, events, meetups and unconferences.\r\n- [SoC.md](https://github.com/svaksha/50/blob/master/SoC.md) :: Summer of Code programs for Women.\r\n- [University.md](https://github.com/svaksha/50/blob/master/University.md) :: Scholarships for women pursuing STEM research and graduate studies at Universities. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# CONTRIBUTING\r\nFeel free to submit a [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/svaksha/50/pulls), if you wish to list any company, conference, foundation or organization that funds diversity initiatives for women.\r\n\r\n### Guidelines for listing Events\r\n- This is NOT a generic events or conference list, hence, *only those conferences that explicitly publish their grants and financial aid programs for women (and those who identify as one) will be listed*. For generic events and conferences, use [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/).\r\n- Please dont list events that expect women to contact the organizers regarding FA grants as this places an extra burden on women to do the\r\nlegwork of making their conference a success by begging for FA to speak at or attend it. @ashedryden has written a nice article on \"[Increasing Diversity at Your Conference](http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/increasing-diversity-at-your-conference)\". \r\n\r\n\r\n### Guidelines to submit a PR:\r\n- Add your link as per the topic, in _alphabetical order_, with notes (if any) to the respective section in the markdown files.\r\n- For broken links or outdated information, submit a bug report, or make the necessary changes and submit a PR.\r\n- For those unable to use git, create a github account, fork the '50' repo, then [edit the page by clicking on the \"pencil\" icon on the markdown page](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository), then submit a PR. Github does this [automatically in 8 steps](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository).\r\n\r\n\r\n# LICENSE \r\n- This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License - (CC-BY-SA-3.0).
