Women form half of the world's population and despite the uproar over "diversity" in CS (STEM) fields, hardly get any financial support for higher studies or opportunities to attend conferences. The word "diversity" and "women" should encompass women from ALL over the world, but sadly most of the diversity grants either discriminate or restrict it to women who are already citizens of the first world and enjoy facilities and privileges that women from a third world country dont have access to or enjoy. **[50-DI](http://svaksha.github.io/50-DI)** is a curated Diversity Index of grants, scholarships, travel and financial aid offered to women from ALL over the world, by conferences and companies sponsoring STEM education to encourage diversity in STEM fields among __half the world's population__.

# 50-Diversity-Index
Information is divided into the following sub-pages:

- [Events.md](https://github.com/svaksha/50/blob/master/Events.md) :: Financial aid and travel grant information for women attending or speaking at barcamps, camps, conferences, events, meetups and unconferences.
- [SoC.md](https://github.com/svaksha/50/blob/master/SoC.md) :: Summer of Code programs for Women.
- [University.md](https://github.com/svaksha/50/blob/master/University.md) :: Scholarships for women pursuing STEM research and graduate studies at Universities. 



# CONTRIBUTING
Feel free to submit a [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/svaksha/50-DI/pulls), if you wish to list any company, conference, foundation or organization that funds diversity initiatives for women.

### Guidelines for listing Events
- This is NOT a generic events or conference list, hence, *only those conferences that explicitly publish their grants and financial aid programs for women (and those who identify as one) will be listed*. For generic events and conferences, use [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/).
- Please dont list events that expect women to contact the organizers regarding FA grants as this places an extra burden on women to do the
legwork of making their conference a success by begging for FA to speak at or attend it. @ashedryden has written a nice article on "[Increasing Diversity at Your Conference](http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/increasing-diversity-at-your-conference)". 


### Guidelines to submit a PR:
- Add your link as per the topic, in _alphabetical order_, with notes (if any) to the respective section in the markdown files.
- For broken links or outdated information, submit a bug report, or make the necessary changes and submit a PR.
- For those unable to use git, create a github account, fork the '50' repo, then [edit the page by clicking on the "pencil" icon on the markdown page](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository), then submit a PR. Github does this [automatically in 8 steps](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository).
