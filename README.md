# 50
Information is divided into the following sub-pages:

- [Events.md](https://github.com/svaksha/50/blob/master/Events.md) :: Financial aid and travel grant information for women attending or speaking at barcamps, camps, conferences, events, meetups and unconferences.
- [SoC.md](https://github.com/svaksha/50/blob/master/SoC.md) :: Summer of Code programs for Women.
- [University.md](https://github.com/svaksha/50/blob/master/University.md) :: Scholarships for women pursuing STEM research and graduate studies at Universities. 



# CONTRIBUTING
Feel free to submit a [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/svaksha/50/pulls), if you wish to list any company, conference, foundation or organization that funds diversity initiatives for women.

### Guidelines for listing Events
- This is NOT a generic events or conference list, hence, *only those conferences that explicitly publish their grants and financial aid programs for women (and those who identify as one) will be listed*. For generic events and conferences, use [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/).
- Please dont list events that expect women to contact the organizers regarding FA grants as this places an extra burden on women to do the
legwork of making their conference a success by begging for FA to speak at or attend it. @ashedryden has written a nice article on "[Increasing Diversity at Your Conference](http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/increasing-diversity-at-your-conference)". 


### Guidelines to submit a PR:
- Add your link as per the topic, in _alphabetical order_, with notes (if any) to the respective section in the markdown files.
- For broken links or outdated information, submit a bug report, or make the necessary changes and submit a PR.
- For those unable to use git, create a github account, fork the '50' repo, then [edit the page by clicking on the "pencil" icon on the markdown page](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository), then submit a PR. Github does this [automatically in 8 steps](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository).
