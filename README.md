# 50-DiversityIndex
**[50-DI](http://svaksha.github.io/50-DI)** is a curated DiversityIndex of grants, scholarships, travel bursary and/or financial aid offered to women (including those who identify as women in a way that's significant to them) from __ALL around the world__, by conferences and companies sponsoring education to encourage diversity in STEM fields among __half the world's population__. 

Women are **half** the world's population and despite the uproar over the lack of **diversity** in the Computer Science field, they hardly get any financial support for higher studies or opportunities to attend conferences. A common myth that accompanies any "diversity" discussion is the perception that because admissions to CS is open to everyone, if women were really interested in programming or Math, they would enroll to study it, BUT the leaky pipeline wherefrom existing women leave tech due to misogyny, harassment, or subtle sexism and/or are forced to remain silent due to the lack of support is hardly ever accounted for. This is more prominent within FOSS communities where the lack of a CoC, or reluctance to adopt one and implement it uniformly across all online communities from every country, results in a free pass to sexist misogyny and online harassment, directly impacting diversity. Besides this, women are highly underrepresented in senior research positions and there is an attempt to tell their stories via a book - see the [CFP for personal stories from women in science](http://boundaryvision.com/2014/08/27/call-for-papers-personal-stories-from-women-in-science/).

### Track the international DiversityIndex 
There are attempts to bridge this gap with grants and this repo attempts to measure the global reality when we talk of "diversity" and "women" - words that should encompass women from ALL over the world, but a disparity of unequal proportions is created when diversity grants and financial aid are restricted to women who are citizens of the first world countries. Altruism to women who already enjoy facilities and privileges that women living in a third world country dont have access to, nor dream of, creates a dichotomy of unequals and this invisible inequality is deliberately ignored and never quantified by women-in-tech groups.

Track the DiversityIndex and quantify _how_ much help is actually available to women from the following:

+ [di-conferences-events.md](https://github.com/svaksha/50-DI/blob/master/di-conferences-events.md) :: Track the DiversityIndex of women attending or speaking at barcamps, bootcamps, conferences, meetups, unconferences and other events thanks to financial aid and travel grants.
+ [di-edu-postdoc-research.md](https://github.com/svaksha/50-DI/blob/master/di-edu-postdoc-research.md) :: Post Doctoral Research grants. 
+ [di-edu-university.md](https://github.com/svaksha/50-DI/blob/master/di-edu-university.md) :: Track the DiversityIndex in scholarships and fellowships for women graduates interested in pursuing higher education in CS research and/or graduate studies at different Universities around the world. 
+ [di-internships.md](https://github.com/svaksha/50-DI/blob/master/di-foss-internships.md) :: Summer of Code programs and internships open to women applicants.
+ [notes-speakers.md](https://github.com/svaksha/50-DI/blob/master/notes-speakers.md) :: Useful tips for conference speakers.

## Contributing 
Please submit a [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/svaksha/50-DI/pulls), if you wish to list any company, conference, foundation or organization that funds diversity initiatives for women.

#### Guidelines for listing Grants
+ This is NOT a generic list of events or conferences, hence, **only those conferences/ events that explicitly publish their grants and financial aid programs for women (including those who identify as women in a way that's significant to them) will be listed**. For a generic list of events and conferences, use [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/).
+ Please dont list events that expect women to contact the organizers regarding FA grants as this places an extra burden on women to do the legwork of making their conference a success by begging for FA to speak at, or attend the conference. Reading @ashedryden 's article on "[Increasing Diversity at Your Conference](http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/increasing-diversity-at-your-conference)" is an eye-opener. 
+ Please dont list research grants that discriminate and restrict applicants on the basis of age, if this information is known or publicly available. 

#### Guidelines to submit a PR
+ Add your link as per the topic, in _alphabetical order_, with notes (if any) to the respective section in the markdown files.
+ For broken links or outdated information, submit a bug report, or make the necessary changes and submit a PR.
+ For those unable to use git, create a github account, fork the `50-DI` repo and [edit the page by clicking on the "pencil" icon on the markdown page](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository), click on save and submit a PR. Github does this [automatically in 8 steps](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository).
