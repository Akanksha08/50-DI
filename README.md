## Contributing
If you know any conference, company or organization that funds diversity initiatives, feel free to submit a [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/svaksha/50/pulls). Some guidelines to submit a PR:

- This is NOT a generic events or conference list, hence, only those conferences that explicitly publish their grants and financial aid programs for women (and those who identify as one) will be listed. For a generic events and conference list, use [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/).
- Add your link as per the topic, in _alphabetical order_, with notes (if any) to the respective section in the markdown files.
- For broken links or outdated information, submit a bug report, or make the necessary changes and submit a PR.
