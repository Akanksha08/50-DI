**[50-DI](http://svaksha.github.io/50-DI)** is a curated Diversity Index of grants, scholarships, travel and financial aid offered to women from __ALL over the world__, by conferences and companies sponsoring education to encourage diversity in STEM fields among __half the world's population__. 

Women form half of the world's population and despite the uproar over the lack of "diversity" in the Computer Science field, they hardly get any financial support for higher studies or opportunities to attend conferences. A common myth that accompanies any "diversity" discussion is the perception that because admissions to CS is open to everyone, if women were really interested in programming or Math, they would enroll to study it, but the leaky pipeline that sees existing women leaving tech and lack of support is hardly ever accounted for. Besides, women are highly underrepresented in senior research positions and there is an attempt to tell their stories via a book - see the [CFP for personal stories from women in science](http://boundaryvision.com/2014/08/27/call-for-papers-personal-stories-from-women-in-science/).

There are attempts to bridge this gap with grants and this repo attempts to measure the ground reality when we talk of "diversity" and "women" - words that should encompass women from ALL over the world, but the reality is that most of the diversity grants discriminate and restrict financial aid to women who are citizens of the first world countries; ironically, to those who enjoy facilities and privileges that women from a third world country dont have access to, nor dream of - an invisible inequality and disparity that is hardly spoken about, much less quantified.

# 50-Diversity-Index
Information is divided into the following sub-pages:

- [Events.md](https://github.com/svaksha/50-DI/blob/master/Events.md) :: Financial aid and travel grant information for women attending or speaking at barcamps, camps, conferences, events, meetups and unconferences.
- [Internships.md](https://github.com/svaksha/50-DI/blob/master/Internships.md) :: Short internships and Summer of Code programs for Women.
- [University.md](https://github.com/svaksha/50-DI/blob/master/University.md) :: Scholarships and fellowships for female graduates interested in pursuing CS research and/or graduate studies at different Universities. 



# CONTRIBUTING
Feel free to submit a [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/svaksha/50-DI/pulls), if you wish to list any company, conference, foundation or organization that funds diversity initiatives for women.

### Guidelines for listing Events
- This is NOT a generic events or conference list, hence, **only those conferences that explicitly publish their grants and financial aid programs for women (and those who identify as one) will be listed**. For generic events and conferences, use [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/).
- Please dont list events that expect women to contact the organizers regarding FA grants as this places an extra burden on women to do the
legwork of making their conference a success by begging for FA to speak at, or attend the conference. @ashedryden has written a nice article on "[Increasing Diversity at Your Conference](http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/increasing-diversity-at-your-conference)". 


### Guidelines to submit a PR
- Add your link as per the topic, in _alphabetical order_, with notes (if any) to the respective section in the markdown files.
